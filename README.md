# Connect4
This project was a final for cs210 with Professor Steinwand. This program is meant to be used on a Jupyter Notebook and implements the Pygame library.

Connect 4 is a two-player game where one player uses the red chips and the other plays as the yellow chips. The goal of the game is to be the first player to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's tokens.

To run the game open the Connect4.ipynb file in a Jupyter Notebook and run the cells. A Pygame surface window should appear with the game board and a colored chip hovering above the board. Use the left and right arrows to move the active chip side by side and the down arrow to drop the game piece into a column. Once a game is complete, the spacebar can be pressed to reset the board and play again.
